## tutorial
So far, this game isn't really a game per se but I'm still going to go over the features.
### Inventory
Click the toggle inventory button to open/close the inventory. Inside the inventory are your items - a bolt action rifle dealing 70 damage per shot, a pistol dealing 30 damage per shot, and 5 medkits that can heal you back up to full health. There is a button next to the guns that allow you to equip/unequip them. When equipped, your character will fire that gun. When no gun is equipped, your character will enter melee combat.
### Fighting
There is a button at the bottom of the page: Fight. It lets you fight an enemy soldier with your equipped weapon (or your hands). After defeating an enemy, another one will spawn. Enemies won't attack you, they can only deal defensive damage when you fight them. Each new enemy spawned will get stronger based on how much XP you have.

## trivia i guess
Killing an enemy will grant you XP equivalent to the enemy's max health, along with a random amount of ammunition from 0-20 for each of your guns.<br/>
Characters have both melee damage and a gun slot. Melee damage varies based on the character's health, but gun damage stays constant no matter what health the character has (unless they're dead).<br/>
When fighting with a gun with no ammo (or no gun, obviously), characters deal melee damage instead of gun damage.<br/>
Leveling up follows a Fibonacci sequence. The amount of xp needed for the next level is equal to the last two amounts of xp needed.<br/>
