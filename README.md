## just writing some stuff down so i dont forget them
Killing an enemy will grant you XP equivalent to the enemy's max health, along with a random amount of ammunition from 0-20 for each of your guns.<br/>
Characters have both melee damage and a gun slot. Melee damage varies based on the character's health, but gun damage stays constant no matter what health the character has (unless they're dead).<br/>
When fighting with a gun with no ammo (or no gun, obviously), characters deal melee damage instead of gun damage.<br/>
Leveling up follows a Fibonacci sequence. The amount of xp needed for the next level is equal to the last two amounts of xp needed.<br/>
