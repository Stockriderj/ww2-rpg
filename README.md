Killing an enemy will grant you XP equivalent to the enemy's max health.
Characters have both melee damage and a gun slot. Melee damage varies based on the character's health, but gun damage stays constant no matter what health the character has (unless they're dead).
When fighting with a gun with no ammo, characters deal melee damage instead of gun damage.
